  - Creating and assigning a **new user in Intune**
  - Enrolling the device into **Microsoft Intune**

## 🧠 What I learned
- How customizablew Windows Server GMPC tool is
- How committed I am to the this repo and more projects lets me know that I am moving in the right direction. Also it holds me accountable. Mainly because this repo is for me and I would be lying to myself if I wasnt honest.

## 💭 Personal Note

- Prioritized knowledge transfer and team support for the day
- Will hone in on Studying and homelab this weekend. Want to get to the next Section (Social Engineering) before monday.
