# 🗓️ Daily Log – April 9, 2025

## ✅ What I Did Today

- With the extensive help from ChatGpt I was able toaccomplish a few things
- Continued building out my **Kali Linux Hardening** project  
  - Created `hardening-script.sh` with:
    - UFW firewall (deny incoming by default)
    - SSH root login disabled
    - Password policy (min length + lockout)
    - Disabled unnecessary services
    - Hardened home directory permissions
- Added Phase 1 files:
  - `Before-After.md`
  - `References.md`
- Started **Phase 2** plans (auditd, bash history cleanup), but paused to fully understand Phase 1 first

- Created `STIG-to-GPO-Automation` repo:
  - Script applies DISA STIGs to **Default Domain Controllers Policy** via GPMC
  - Documented everything in `GPO_Changes.md` and `STIG_Mapping.md`

- Reviewed and customized **GitHub Profile README**
  - Documented skills, goals, and journey
  - Connected current projects to future cybersecurity/cloud goals

- Practiced answering STIG and Kali quiz questions with mentor guidance

## 💡 What I Learned

- The difference between local security policy enforcement (`secedit`) vs. domain-level (`Set-GPRegistryValue`)
- Why disabling SMBv1 and enforcing NTLMv2 is essential for Windows Server hardening
- How to translate STIG requirements into PowerShell/GPO logic
- Basics of what `chmod 1777 /tmp` does and why sticky bit matters
- Reinforced importance of limiting root login + password policies on Kali

---

## 🧠 What Challenged Me

- Parsing STIG GPO backups (figuring out which `.xml` or GUID folder matters)
- Understanding what’s happening *under the hood* in some hardening scripts
- Security+ Cryptography section is dense and long — needed to slow down to absorb

---

## 🔄 What I’ll Focus On Tomorrow

- Continue Cryptography section in Security+ (target: reach 75%)
- Add at least one STIG rule to `Apply-STIG-GPO.ps1`
- Possibly start a `hardening-check.sh` script for Kali
- Reflect on bash and shell command chaining (`&&`, `||`, `|`)
- Log another GitHub daily and stay consistent 🔁
